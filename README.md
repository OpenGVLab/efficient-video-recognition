## Introduction

The overall architecture of the EVL framework includes a trainable Transformer decoder, trainable local temporal modules and a pretrained, fixed image backbone
(CLIP is used for instance).

Using a fixed backbone significantly saves training time, and we managed to train a ViT-B/16 with 8 frames for 50 epochs in 60 GPU-hours (NVIDIA V100).

Despite with a small training computation and memory consumption, EVL models achieves high performance on Kinetics-400. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods
are as follows

## Installation

We tested the released code with the following conda environment

```
conda create -n pt1.9.0cu11.1_official -c pytorch -c conda-forge pytorch=1.9.0=py3.9_cuda11.1_cudnn8.0.5_0 cudatoolkit torchvision av
```

## Data Preparation

We expect that `--train_list_path` and `--val_list_path` command line arguments to be a data list file of the following format
```
<path_1> <label_1>
<path_2> <label_2>
...
<path_n> <label_n>
```
where `<path_i>` points to a video file, and `<label_i>` is an integer between `0` and `num_classes - 1`.
`--num_classes` should also be specified in the command line argument.

Additionally, `<path_i>` might be a relative path when `--data_root` is specified, and the actual path will be
relative to the path passed as `--data_root`.

The class mappings in the open-source weights are provided at [Kinetics-400 class mappings](data/k400_class_mappings.json)

## Backbone Preparation

CLIP weights need to be downloaded from [CLIP official repo](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/blob/d50d76daa670286dd6cacf3bcd80b5e4823fc8e1/clip/clip.py#L30)
and passed to the `--backbone_path` command line argument.

## Script Usage

Training and evaliation scripts are provided in the scripts folder.
Scripts should be ready to run once the environment is setup and 
`--backbone_path`, `--train_list_path` and `--val_list_path` are replaced with your own paths.

For other command line arguments please see the help message for usage.

## Kinetics-400 Main Results

This is a re-implementation for open-source use. Checkpoints and scripts will be released soon.

## Data Loading Speed

As the training process is fast, video frames are consumed at a very high rate.
For easier installation, the current version uses PyTorch-builtin data loaders.
They are not very efficient and can become a bottleneck when using ViT-B as backbones.
We provide a `--dummy_dataset` option to bypass actual video decoding for training speed measurement. 
The model accuracy should not be affected. 
Our internal data loader is pure C++-based and does not bottleneck training by much on a machine with 2x Xeon Gold 6148 CPUs and 4x V100 GPUs.
